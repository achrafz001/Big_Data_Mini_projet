# Big_Data_Mini_projet
Academic Project : Big Data, Cloud Computing, Stochastic Processes, Environmental Data


##Goal of this practice : \\
● Work on a platform for cloud computing
● Use big data tools
● Manipulate large datasets
● Apply statistical methods
● 5 years of satellite observations (~50Go)

## The technology behind the GCP and BigQuery :
● **BigQuery:**
  ○ based on the NoSQL language
  ○ map/reduce on thousands of machines
  ○ machine learning is now available
  ○ it's completely transparent and extremely
  efficient!

● **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):**
  ○ not free!
  ○ you pay the storage, the clusters, the
  BigQuery requests
  ○ use Google Colab to speak with GCP anBigQuery

###A Jupyter Notebook with 5 questions
● Geophysical data:
  ○ geographic maps
  ○ time series
  ○ scatterplots
● Stochastic processes:
  ○ time series modelling
  ○ autocorrelation
  ○ predictions
